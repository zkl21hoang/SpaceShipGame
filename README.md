#### This is my game project which was developed by using Ruby programming language as part of my final assignment of COS10009 unit at Swinbunre University of Technology.
This game is created with the goal to survive from spaceship wave. The player will be provided three types of gun and limited amount of ammo. Each type of gun has its special mechanism and type of ammo corresponding to different damage levels. Ammo will appear randomly in the map to supply the player. The player will try their best to survive from each wave of spaceship.
