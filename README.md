# Killing Spaceship Game
#### Release Date: July 2020
+ (sudo) gem install gosu
+ ruby spaceshipkiller.rb
####
This is my game project, which was developed using the Ruby programming language as part of my final assignment for the COS10009 course at the Swinburne University of Technology. The goal of this game is to survive from spaceship attack waves.
The player will be provided with three types of guns and a limited amount of ammo. Each type of gun has its own special mechanism and type of ammunition corresponding to different damage levels. Ammo will appear randomly on the map to supply the player. The player will try their best to survive each attack wave of the spaceship.
